# Create Feeble App

Create Feeble apps with no build configuration.

## tl;dr

```sh
npm install -g create-feeble-app

create-feeble-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start

```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

The rest of it is quite similar to original tool, you can read its docs [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#getting-started).
